# For temporary Docker build contexts or generated files if not managed otherwise
# .docker-build/
# docker-compose.override.yml # If it's for local specific override not to be committed

# --- Package Manager Cache / Lock Files (optional, depend on project setup) ---
# It's usually good practice to commit lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml)
# but if you have a very specific reason to ignore them for temporary local development:
# package-lock.json
# yarn.lock
# pnpm-lock.yaml

# --- Miscellaneous generated files (add as needed) ---
# Example for static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo:
# /_site/
# /public/
